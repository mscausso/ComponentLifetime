# Component Lifetime

The component lifetime report of a mining equipment helps visualize the number of hours a piece of equipment has operated. It also analyzes the failures that caused the component to stop functioning. This type of report helps the diagnostic team develop preventive maintenance strategies for the mining equipment to prevent future failures or extend the operational life of the mining equipment.
